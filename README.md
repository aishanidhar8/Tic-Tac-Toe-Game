# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to mark 3 spaces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins. This project aims to implement the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly and interactive gaming experience.
